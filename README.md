# Iris Classification using Decision Trees and Random Forests
This project demonstrates the use of Decision Trees and Random Forests for classifying iris flowers based on their characteristics. The code utilizes scikit-learn library to load the iris dataset, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
Features
Decision Tree Classification: Train a decision tree classifier with and without depth limit, and evaluate its performance using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
Random Forest Classification: Train a random forest classifier and evaluate its performance using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
Feature Importance: Calculate and visualize feature importances using random forest classifier.
Cross-Validation: Perform cross-validation to estimate the robust accuracy of decision tree and random forest classifiers.
Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
Usage
